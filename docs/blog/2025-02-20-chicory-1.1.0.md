We’re excited to announce the release of **Chicory 1.1.0**! This update brings significant performance improvements, enhanced compliance, and greater flexibility—all while maintaining full backward compatibility.

## SIMD Support

After extensive development and testing, Chicory now fully supports **SIMD instructions** in the interpreter. This implementation leverages the experimental **Vector API** available in Java 21+, unlocking substantial performance gains for workloads that can take advantage of parallel processing.

Find out how to enable SIMD in your project by visiting the [documentation][simd].

## Optimized Memory Management

Memory management is now highly customizable, allowing fine-tuned control based on your application’s needs. Additionally, we’ve optimized the default implementation to deliver **the best possible performance**, informed by real-world benchmarks and user feedback.

Learn how to configure memory settings in the [documentation][memory].

## Join the Chicory Community
