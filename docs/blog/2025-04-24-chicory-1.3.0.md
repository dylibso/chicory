# Chicory **1.3.0** – Released April 24, 2025

🚀 **AOT Just Got Serious**

With incredible contributions from **Hiram Chirino**, Chicory's ahead-of-time (AOT) compiler continues to mature, bringing us one step closer to leaving the experimental phase behind.

**Highlights include:**

- 🧠 **No More Param Limits**: The previous cap of 255 function parameters? Gone.
- 🏗️ **Bye-Bye `ClassTooLargeError`**: We've refactored code generation for large WASM modules to avoid hitting JVM class size limits.

---

🛠️ **Bug Fixes & Improvements**

This release includes the usual refinements and one particularly notable fix:

- 💡 **Random, Now Smarter**: To resolve issues with `native-image` compilation, we've changed the default random source in `WasiOptions` from `SecureRandom` to `ThreadLocalRandom`. This makes it more compatible with GraalVM.

If your application relies on the previous behavior, you can restore it with:

```java
WasiOptions.builder()
  .withRandom(new SecureRandom())
  .build();
```
