## Chicory **1.6.0**: Java Modules, Performance, and Enhanced Proposals

**Release date: 2025-11-07**

Chicory 1.6.0 brings Java Platform Module System (JPMS) support, significant performance improvements with directory-backed caching, enhanced Threads proposal support, and Extended Constant Expressions. This release also adds Java 25 support and improves the developer experience with better APIs.

### Highlights

#### Java Platform Module System (JPMS) Support

* Full Java module definitions (`module-info.java`) added across all Chicory modules, enabling proper module boundaries and encapsulation.
* Chicory is now fully compatible with Java 9+ module system requirements, making it easier to use in modular Java applications.

#### Directory-Backed Runtime Compiler Cache

* New experimental directory-based cache implementation for the runtime compiler, significantly improving startup performance for repeated module executions.
* Thread-safe and process-safe cache implementation using atomic file operations.
* Cache entries are stored as JAR files, keyed by module digest, enabling fast subsequent loads without recompilation.

#### Enhanced Threads Proposal Support

* Atomic fence instruction implementation, completing the Threads proposal support for proper memory ordering in concurrent WebAssembly execution.
* Full spec-compliant atomic operations for multi-threaded WebAssembly modules.

#### Extended Constant Expressions Proposal

* Implementation of the Extended Constant Expressions proposal, enabling more complex constant expressions in WebAssembly modules.
* Supports advanced constant evaluation capabilities in WebAssembly modules.

### Other Improvements

* **CompiledModule Interface**: New interface to make it easier to work with multiple build-time compiled modules, improving the developer experience.
* **Performance Optimization**: Cache `WasmModule` in static fields to avoid parsing modules multiple times.
* **Java 25 Support**: Full compatibility with the latest Java release.
* **API Improvements**: Sanitized method and field names in annotation processor for better code generation.
* **Bug Fixes**: Fixed WASI testsuite returning unsupported operation errors.
