## Chicory **1.5.0**: Spec-Compliant EH and Threads, Across the Board

**Release date: 2025-07-04**

Chicory 1.5.0 introduces full support for both the WebAssembly Exception Handling and Threads proposals, implemented across both the compiler and interpreter. This release ensures spec-compliant control flow and concurrent execution for your WebAssembly modules on the JVM.

### Highlights

#### WebAssembly Exception Handling Support

* Implemented the official WebAssembly Exception Handling proposal in the compiler, complementing existing interpreter support.
* End-to-end exception handling support: compiler and interpreter fully round-trip exception constructs across boundaries.

#### WebAssembly Threads Proposal Implementation

* Added support for the Threads proposal in both compiler and interpreter.

### Other Improvements

* Increased CI coverage running nightly the Zig standard library testsuite

A huge thank you, as usual, to all contributors for bringing full WebAssembly Exception Handling and Threads support to Chicory across both compiler and interpreter. Check out the commit history for detailed implementation notes, and as always, let us know how it performs in your workloads!

Happy WebAssembly-in-the-JVM coding! ðŸš€
