Chicory **1.2.0** is here! Along with the usual bug fixes and dependency updates, this release brings key improvements. Here’s what’s new:

## 🚀 Exception Handling  

The [Exception Handling proposal](https://github.com/WebAssembly/exception-handling), now at Phase 4, has been implemented in the interpreter.  

## 🔧 WasmModuleInterface  

This is a **breaking change** in the experimental module: `host-module-processor-experimental`.  
Exports now generate a **class** instead of an **interface**, enabling caching for faster lookups and invocations.  

## 🔁 Tail Call Support  

Tail call opcodes are now recognized in the compiler, improving optimization potential.  

## 📢 Join the Chicory Community  

A huge thank you to all our [contributors](https://github.com/dylibso/chicory/graphs/contributors) for their exceptional work on this release!
