# WASI

This library contains code for instantiating and running WASI modules.
[WASI](https://wasi.dev/) is a virtual system interface that provides POSIX-like syscalls and is supported
by many of the compilers out there. This library implements the widely-available version 0.1
of the spec, also known as `wasip1`.
